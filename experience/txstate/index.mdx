            <div className="justify-end ">I’m a Texas State University Master of Computer Science Graduate. I’m a programmer, designer and a big-time foodie. I was born in the small town of India, where I pursued my bachelor’s degree. I currently dwell in beautiful city of San Marcos, Texas. I am curious and motivated to learn new skills and apply it to new projects. If anything, new gets caught up in my eye, I always unravel and try to come up with innovative and improved ideas.
