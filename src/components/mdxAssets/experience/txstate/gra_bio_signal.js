              My role was to create a methodology to collect bio-signal data while participants are experiencing stressorâ€™s and test machine learning methodologies to automatically analyze stress level.

              The project is successfully deployed and is able to reduce the contact tracing time by up to 60%. Major features of the project includ multi-device and screen reader support with the ability to auto-detect the spread of COVID cases.
              Bobcat Trace also has the ability to trace potential locations and people who might have been in touch with POI.
