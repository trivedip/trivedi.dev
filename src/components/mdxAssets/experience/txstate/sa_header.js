              <div className="justify-start leading-8">I joined as part of Vice Presidentâ€™s office and later joined newly formed technology division. My work here was associated with planning, designing, developing & maintaining software and web applications.
              As my role here was dynamic, I was able to work on all stages of software life cycle, I was also part of technology migration team and software pipeline development process. I acted as lead developer on projects like in-house COVID-19 contact tracing application called Bobcat Trace which reduced the contact tracing times of up to 70%.
