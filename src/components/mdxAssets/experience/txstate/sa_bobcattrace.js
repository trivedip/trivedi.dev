              My duty involved: planning, feasibility analysis, developing, designing, deploying, DevOps, and maintaining the project. 
              <br/>              
              <br/>              
              The project is successfully deployed and is able to reduce the contact tracing time by up to 60%. Major features of the project includ multi-device and screen reader support with the ability to auto-detect the spread of COVID cases.
              Bobcat Trace also has the ability to trace potential locations and people who might have been in touch with POI.
